    abstract={In this paper, we consider a linear Korteweg-de Vries equation posed in a bounded interval and study the time dependency with respect to the interval length and the transport coefficient, for which the uniform null controllability holds as the dispersion coefficient goes to zero. We consider two cases of boundary controls. First, only one control on the left end of the interval, and then, two controls acting on the right. The strategy is based on the combination of an exponential dissipation inequality and suitable Carleman estimates for each case.}

    TITLE={Global propagation of analyticity and unique continuation for semilinear waves},
    JOURNAL={Submitted.},
    YEAR={2024},

    abstract={In this article, we develop a new method to prove both global propagation of analyticity and unique continuation in finite time for solutions of semilinear wave-type equations with analytic nonlinearity. It combines control theory techniques and Galerkin approximation, inspired by Hale-Raugel, to prove that analyticity in time can be propagated for the nonlinear equation from a zone where linear observability holds towards the full space. For semilinear wave equations with Dirichlet boundary condition on a bounded domain, this implies that analyticity can be propagated to the entire domain from a subset $\omega$ that satisfies the geometric control condition. It also implies the unique continuation when the solution is assumed to be zero on $\omega$. When the nonlinearity is assumed to be subcritical and defocusing, we also obtain observability estimates in the optimal time of the geometric control condition. For semilinear plate equations, similar propagation of analyticity is achieved by assuming the controllability of the linear Schr\"odinger equation. }
