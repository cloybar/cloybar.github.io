I am a PhD student at the [Laboratoire Jacques-Louis Lions](https://www.ljll.fr/) at [Sorbonne Université](https://www.sorbonne-universite.fr). I am working under the supervision of [Camille Laurent](https://laurentca.perso.math.cnrs.fr/) (CNRS, URCA, Reims).

Previously, I obtained the MSc. in Mathematics and the professional title of Mathematical Engineer at [Universidad Técnica Federico Santa María](https://usm.cl) in Valparaíso, Chile. My Master's thesis was directed by [Nicolás Carreño](http://ncarreno.mat.utfsm.cl) and [Alberto Mercado](http://amercado.mat.utfsm.cl/).

I am interested in the analysis and control of partial differential equations, particularly those of dispersive type. My current research focuses on unique continuation problems for semilinear PDEs—such as wave, Schrödinger, and plate equations—under suitable geometric conditions, as well as their applications to control theory. I am also interested in control problems for PDEs with discontinuities across interfaces in the main coefficients, as well as in techniques from semiclassical and microlocal analysis.
